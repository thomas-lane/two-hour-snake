This is a small snake game I made in less than two hours in C. The controls are the arrow keys. It is not anything fancy but it was fun to make. Figuring out exactly how to use Microsoft's C compiler and tools (cl.exe, nmake.exe) and integrate them into Visual Studio Code in the `tasks.json` and `launch.json` files was not part of the time reported.
